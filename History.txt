=== 0.1.8 / 2010-2-16
  * Updated for compatability with ffi 0.6.x's new requirement that 
    libraries be included with 'ffi_lib' even if they are already linked.

=== 0.1.7 / 2010-2-05
  * Fixed bugs with FFI::Unions
  * Revamped the dsl_layout builder so that it just wraps layout() instead of
    attempting to duplicate its functionlity. This will hopefully stop causing
    compatibility issues with FFI as it changes its internals and new versions 
    are released.
  * :p_struct is an attribute that can be used on any field with a type of 
    :pointer.
  * Added new experimental feature for the DSL where new fields can be defined
    by their name as a method name in dsl_layout {} instead of having to 
    prefix field/array/struct for each.
  * A warning is now issued when a struct field name cannot be mapped to an
    accessor method because it would cause a conflict. These used to just be
    silently skipped. Now the warning is issued if warnings are enabled.

=== 0.1.6 / 2010-1-18
  * support win32 with wsock32.dll for NetEndian helper stuff.
  * support StructHelper for FFI::Unions
  * support passing arguments to StructLayoutBuilder in dsl_layout()
  * allow overriding copy_size to address incorrect alignment issues in FFI

=== 0.1.5 / 2010-1-4
  * Added p_struct dsl directive sugar for creating FFI::Struct accessors to 
    handle pointers to structs.

=== 0.1.4 / 2010-1-1
  * Support for FFI 0.5.0 final and up.
  * Added NetStructHelper with accessors to provide automatic network byte 
    order conversion on network packet structures.
